  <p>NEW PIANO MUSIC.&mdash;"The celebrated Composer, Theodore
  Oesten.&mdash;It is always with particular pleasure we direct our
  attention to those subjects which are interesting to our fairer
  readers&mdash;such, for instance, as the musical topics of the day. Every
  fair pianiste is acquainted with the name of Theodore Oesten; every piano
  is loaded with his gay and beautiful productions. Who does not know, or,
  knowing, does not admire, his 'Valse Elegante?' Who is insensible to his
  beautiful interpretation of Küchen's 'Cradle Song' (Schlummerlied), or
  his very many elegant transpositions for the pianoforte, as 'Rousseau's
  Dream,' Beethoven's admired 'Adelaide,' and his very remarkable
  arrangement of our glorious National Anthem 'God Save the
  Queen'&mdash;all of them worthy (and that is not to say a little) of the
  popular arranger of the charming 'When the Swallows hasten Home.' The
  singular merits of Theodore Oesten have not escaped the vigilant eye of
  her Majesty's music publishers, the Messrs. Robert Cocks &amp; Co. having
  secured, as we are informed, the exclusive copyright of his works for

<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>"SHAKSPEARE'S RIME WHICH HE MADE AT THE MYTRE."</h3>

  <p>In the third volume of Mr. Collier's valuable <i>History of Dramatic
  Poetry</i> (p. 275.) is the following passage, which forms part of a
  note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Mr. Thorpe, the enterprising bookseller of Bedford Street, is in
  possession of a MS. full of songs and poems, in the handwriting of a
  person of the name of Richard Jackson, all copied prior to the year 1631,
  and including many unpublished pieces, by a variety of celebrated poets.
  One of the most curious is a song in five seven-line stanzas, thus headed
  'Shakspeare's rime, which he made at the Mytre in Fleete Streete.' It
  begins 'From the rich Lavinian shore;' and some few of the lines were
  published by Playford, and set as a catch."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In Mr. Thoms' <i>Anecdotes and Traditions</i> (published by the Camden
  Society) is a story of the celebrated Dr. John Wilson, to which the
  editor has appended an interesting note, adding:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Wilson was the composer of a glee for three voices, published in
  Playford's <i>Musical Companion</i>, where the words are attributed to
  Shakspeare; and the supposition that they were really written by him
  having been converted into a certainty, by their appearing with
  Shakspeare's name to them in the MS. Collection of Poetry, copied prior
  to 1631 by Richard Jackson," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Thoms then prints the "rime," not inappropriately calling it "A
  Song for Autolycus," with this remark:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"My late respected friend Mr. Douce once told me, that some musical
  friend at Chichester, I think the organist, possessed a copy of this
  song, with an additional verse."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Thoms' version of "Shakspeare's Rime" was inserted (probably by
  our worthy Editor himself?) in the first volume of "N. &amp; Q." (p. 23.)
  with a view of obtaining the additional stanza; a desideratum which I am
  now enabled to supply. The following copy has <i>two</i> additional
  stanzas, and is transcribed from a MS. Collection of Songs, with the
  music, written in the early part of the reign of James I. The MS. was
  formerly in the possession of Mr. J.&nbsp;S. Smith, the learned editor of
  <i>Musica Antiqua</i>.</p>

      <p class="i1">Like a wench of fifteen,</p>
      <p>Although you be threescore and ten years old."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>That this song enjoyed extensive popularity in the latter half of the
  seventeenth century, is evinced by the number of printed copies. It is
  found in Playford's <i>Select Ayres and Dialogues</i>, 1659; in Dr.
  Wilson's <i>Cheerfull Ayres and Ballads</i>, 1660; in Playford's <i>Catch
  that Catch Can</i>, 1667; and in many subsequent collections of a similar
  kind. But in none of these works is the name of the writer of the words
  given; and all the copies are deficient of the <i>third</i> and
  <i>fourth</i> stanzas. The point of the satire conveyed in these stanzas
  was lost after the reign of James I., which may account for their
  omission.</p>

  <p>"Shakspeare's rime," being associated with Wilson's music, is of some
  importance towards settling the point of authorship. In 1846 I printed a
  little pamphlet with the following title:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Who was <i>Jack Wilson</i>, the Singer of Shakspeare's Stage? An
  Attempt to prove the Identity of this <!-- Page 440 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page440"></a>{440}</span>Person with John
  Wilson, Doctor of Musick, in the University of Oxford, <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1644."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It would be out of place here to dwell upon this publication, suffice
  it to say, that all the information I have since collected, tends to
  confirm the hypothesis advanced. One extract from this <i>brochure</i>
  will show the connexion that existed between Shakspeare and Wilson:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Wilson was the composer of four other Shakspearian lyrics, a fact
  unknown to Mr. Collier, when he wrote the article in the <i>Shakspeare
  Papers</i>: 'Where the bee sucks,' 'Full fathom five,' 'Lawn as white as
  driven snow,' and 'From the fair Lavinian shore.' They are all printed in
  the author's <i>Cheerfull Ayres or Ballads</i>, Oxford, 1660. We have now
  evidence from this work, that Wilson was the <i>original</i> composer of
  the music to <i>one</i> of Shakspeare's plays. He says in his preface,
  'some of these ayres were <i>originally</i> composed by those whose names
  are affixed to them, but are here placed as being <i>new set</i> by the
  author of the rest. The two songs, 'Where the bee sucks,' and 'Full
  fathom five,' have appended to them the name of 'R. Johnson,' who, upon
  this evidence, we may undoubtedly conclude was the <i>original</i>
  composer of the music in the play of the <i>Tempest</i>. The song 'Lawn
  as white as driven snow,' from the <i>Winter's Tale</i>, has the name of
  'John Wilson' attached to it, from which it is equally certain that he
  was its <i>original</i> composer. In my own mind, the circumstances
  connected with the Shakspearian lyrics in this book are almost conclusive
  as to the identity of John Wilson the <i>composer</i> with John Wilson
  the <i>singer</i>. Unless the composer had been intimately acquainted
  with the theatre of Shakspeare's day, it is not likely that he would have
  remembered, so long after, the name of one of its composers. Nor is it
  likely, being so well acquainted with the <i>original</i> composers of
  the Shakspearian drama, and so anxious as he appears to have been to do
  justice to their memory, that he would have omitted informing us, who was
  the <i>original</i> composer of the song in the <i>Winter's Tale</i>, had
  it been any other than himself. The <i>Winter's Tale</i> was not produced
  before 1610 or 1611, at which period Wilson was sixteen or seventeen
  years old, an age quite ripe enough for the production of the song in
  question."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A reviewer of my little publication in the <i>Athenæum</i> (Nov. 8,
  1846) makes the following remark:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Let us observe, in conclusion, that Dr. Rimbault is better read in
  Jack Wilson than Ben Jonson, or we should never have seen Mr.
  Shakspeare's 'Rime' at the 'Mitre,' in Fleet Street, seriously referred
  to as a genuine composition. It is a mere clumsy adaptation, from Ben's
  interesting epigram 'Inviting a Friend to Supper.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is really too bad to be charged with ignorance <i>unjustly</i>. I
  have on my shelves the works of glorious Ben, three times over: in folio
  1616-31; in folio, 1692; and in nine volumes octave (Gifford's edition),
  1816; all of which I will freely give to the "reviewer," if he can prove
  that <i>one line</i> of "Shakspeare's Rime at the Mytre" is taken from
  the aforesaid epigram. I heartily agree with him in admiration of
  Jonson's spirited imitation of Martial, which I have transcribed as a
  pleasant relish towards digesting these rambling remarks:</p>

<h3>ROUS, THE SCOTTISH PSALMIST, PROVOST OF ETON COLLEGE: AND HIS WILL.</h3>

  <p>Looking over some back Numbers of "N. &amp; Q.," I see an inquiry
  (Vol. v., p.&nbsp;81.) after Francis Rous. G.&nbsp;N. will find an account of him
  in Chalmers's <i>Biographical Dictionary</i>, gathered out of Wood's
  <i>Athenæ</i>; Noble's <i>Memoir of Cromwell</i>, vol. i. <!-- Page 441
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page441"></a>{441}</span>p. 409;
  Lysons' <i>Environs of London</i>, vol. ii.; <i>Granger</i>, vol.
  iii.</p>

  <p>In his will, a copy of which lies before me, proved Feb. 10, 1658, he
  speaks of "a youth in Scotland, his grandson," and "as the heir of
  idleness abhorring to give him an estate, but wishing he might be a
  useful member of Christ and the Commonwealth, he desires his executors to
  give him 50<i>l.</i> a year so long as he shall be in preparation towards
  a profession, and as many of his books as may be fit for him."</p>

  <p>I shall be much obliged if any correspondent can find out anything
  farther about the said "youth in Scotland?"</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">H. T. Ellacombe.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Clyst St. George.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;Why should not "N. &amp; Q." be the publisher of any
  curious old wills, which might interest the general reader? Allow me to
  suggest a corner for <i>Testamenta Vestusta</i>. I will begin by sending
  a copy of the will of Francis Rous.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>This my last Will and Testament, I, Francis Rous,   Provost of Eaton
  College, wrote and made   March 18th, 1657.</p>

  <p>Forasmuch as to put houses in order before our departure is pleasing
  to the God of order, I do dispose of my affairs and estates in manner
  following:</p>

  <p>There is a youth in Scotland concerning whom (because they call him my
  grandson) it is perchance expected that I should do some great matters
  for him; but his father marrying against my will and prohibition, and
  giving me an absolute discharge before the marriage under his hand, not
  to expect anything from me if he did marry contrary to my prohibition, I
  hold myself discharged from the father, and consequently from the son of
  that father, the son having no interest in me but by the father. And I
  hold it a good example, for the benefitt of the Commonwealth, that
  matters of discouragement should be put upon such marriages, being
  assured that their parents will not disinheritt or lessen them,
  especially if they have but one son, and that which Solomon saith is to
  be considered&mdash;an understanding servant shall have rule over a son
  that maketh ashamed, and both that<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, and his son, and his son in
  Scotland have both made ashamed, the one in his match, the other by a sad
  mischief of dangerous consequence and fatal; and though his mother is
  bound to maintain him, yet because I wish he might be a useful member of
  Christ and the Commonwealth, towards which I think she is not well able
  to give him an answerable education, I have in this my will taken course
  for a competent maintenance for him towards a profession, and in it
  utterly abhorring to give him an estate, as the heir of idleness.
  Wherefore to the fore-mentioned purpose, I desire my executor to give him
  50<i>l.</i> a year, so long as he shall be in preparation towards a
  profession, or shall really and seriously be in the practice of it; and
  as many of my books as may be fitt for him in the profession he shall
  undertake, and shall not be given to Pembroke College, I desire my
  executor to give unto him: but if he, or a guardian, or any other, shall
  sue or implead, or call my executor into question to his trouble or cost,
  I leave it to my executor's choice whether he will pay his maintenance of
  50<i>l.</i> per annum, or any part of it.</p>

  <p>I give to Mr. Ellford, my pastor at Acton, 20<i>l.</i> I give
  5<i>l.</i> per annum for ever to be disposed of in buying Bibles,
  catechisms, or for encouraging poor children to learn to read and answer
  in catechising in the parish of Dittisham, in the county of Devon, the
  place of my nativity and baptism, which sum shall be bestowed according
  to the direction of the minister there for the time being; and to the
  present minister I give 20<i>l.</i> I give to the poor of Acton each five
  shillings; I give to the poor of Westminster, Kensington, Knightsbridge,
  half a year's rent of that which they used to receive. I give Mr.
  Bartlett of Windsor 20<i>l.</i> I appoint 100<i>l.</i> to be lent to my
  nephew William Rous, which he must pay by 10<i>l.</i> a year to my nephew
  Richard Rous, his son. I give Thomas Rous, of King's College, 6<i>l.</i>
  for two years. I give Eliz. Rous, of Penrose in Cornwall, 20<i>l.</i> I
  give Anthony Rous at Eaton School, 5<i>l.</i> a year for seven years. I
  give to my niece Rudyard, and her sisters Skelton and Dorothy, each
  20<i>l.</i> I give to Margaret Baker 10<i>l.</i> I give to a poor Xtian
  woman in Dartmouth, Mrs. Adams, 10<i>l.</i> To Robert Needler I give a
  black suit and cloak; the like to William Grantham and 10<i>l.</i> To my
  niece Portman, now in my house, I give 50<i>l.</i> To my other friends of
  more ability, I leave it to my executor to give such memorials as he
  shall think fitt. To the poor of Eaton I give 20<i>l.</i> To each of my
  servants that are with me at any decease I give black suits and
  5<i>l.</i>; and to Peter Fluellen, who is now endeavouring to get a place
  of removal, 10<i>l.</i> I give to Thomas Rolle of Eaton, and Robert Yard,
  each 10<i>l.</i> I give to Christian, now the wife of Mr. Johnson,
  20<i>l.</i> I give to the young Winnington of Eaton, 10<i>l.</i> I give
  40<i>l.</i> per annum out of the Parsonage or Tythe of Great Brookeham in
  Surrey, to maintain two schollars in Pembroke College in Oxford. I also
  give 20<i>l.</i> per annum unto one schollar more in the same college,
  out of a tenement in the Manor of Wootton in Cornwall, during two lives
  of two Bigfords, and after their decease out of a tenement of mine in
  Cowkberry, in Devon, for ever. The scholars to be chosen are to be poor,
  <!-- Page 442 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page442"></a>{442}</span>not having 10<i>l.</i> a year, apt to
  learning, and to be of the posterity of myself or my brother Robert,
  Richard, or Arthur Rous, or of my sister Nicholl, or my sister Upton; and
  if no such shall be tendered, then they are to be chosen out of the two
  highest forms in Eaton College. I give power to my executor to choose
  them during his life, and desire him, with the advice of my dear kinsman,
  Mr. Ambrose Upton, Prebend of Xt Church in Oxford, to settle and order
  all things for the sure and usefull continuance of their allowances to
  schollars so qualified as before and of good conversation, and that they
  study divinity, and some time before they be Batchelors of Arts, they
  make good proof of their studying divinity, and that they continued in
  their several places but <i>seven years</i>, and then others to be chosen
  in their rooms. What shall be above 40<i>l.</i> per annum arising out of
  the tythe of Brookham declaro, and above all rates and taxes, I give unto
  the minister of that parish; and I give the parsonage to my respected
  kinsman Samuel Rous, Esq., of that parish, yet so, that if he die before
  my executor, my executor shall present during his life, and after it
  shall go to the heirs of the said Samuel Rous, it being to be hoped that
  their dwelling be there they will be carefull for their own souls. I do
  make and constitute my dear kinsman Anthony Rous, Esq., of Wootton, in
  the county of Cornwall, commonly called or known by the name of Colonel
  Rous, to be my whole and sole executor. And I give and bequeath to him
  all my lands, tenements, my interest in the parsonage of Great Brookham
  in Surrey, all my leases, chattels, plate, money, and other goodly
  whatsoever, as also my copyholds, which shall, according to custom, be
  made over to him in Acton or Branford, hoping that he will faithfully
  dispose them according to my will and intention made known to him; and I
  give him 100<i>l.</i>, and lend him 200<i>l.</i> more for seven years,
  which he may bestow in defence of himself as to law suits, if any be
  brought as concerning my estate, or if there shall be none to bestow, in
  some charitable use as he shall think fitt. I desire my body may be
  interred and put to rest in the chapple of Eaton College, a place that
  hath my dear affections and prayers that it may be a flouring nursery of
  piety and learning to the end of the world. And for a profession of any
  faith, I refer myself to the works which I not long since published in
  one volume, wherein I have professed a right and saving faith, and hope
  to continue therein until faith shall be swallowed up of sight, laying
  hold of the free grace of God in his beloved Son as my only title to
  eternity, being confident that his free grace, which took me up lying in
  the blood of irregeneration, will wash away the guilt of that estate, and
  all the cursed fruits of it by the pretious blood of his Son, and will
  wash away the filth of it by the spirit of his Son, and so present me
  faultless before the presence of God's glory with joy.</p>

<h3>ORIGINAL ENGLISH ROYAL LETTERS TO THE GRAND MASTERS OF MALTA.</h3>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Charles the Second by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France, and

</blockquote>

  <p>To the most illustrious and most high Prince, the Lord Nicholas
  Cotoner, Grand Master of the Order of Malta, our well-beloved cousin and
  friend&mdash;Greeting:</p>

  <p>It having appeared to us a matter of interest, not only to ourselves,
  but likewise to the whole Christian world, that we also should keep in
  the Mediterranean sea a certain number of galleys ready to afford prompt
  aid to our neighbours and allies against the frequent insults of the
  barbarians and Turks, we lately caused to be constructed two galleys, one
  in Genoa, and the other in the port of Leghorn; in order to man these, we
  directed a person well acquainted with such affairs to be sent, as to
  other parts, so also to the island of Malta, subject to the rule of your
  highness, in order to <i>buy slaves and procure other necessaries</i>. He
  having purchased some slaves, it has been reported to us that your
  highness' collector of customs demanded five pieces of gold of Malta
  money per head before they could be permitted to embark, under the title
  of toll; at which proceeding we were certainly not a little astonished,
  it appearing to us a new proceeding, and one contrary to custom,
  especially it being well known to us that our neighbours and allies, the
  Kings of France and Spain, are never accustomed to pay anything under the
  title of toll <!-- Page 443 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page443"></a>{443}</span>for the slaves which they cause yearly to
  be transported from your island.</p>

  <p>We therefore beg your highness, by the good and long friendship
  existing between us, to grant to us the same privilege in <i>regard to
  this kind of commerce</i> within the territories of your highness, as is
  enjoyed by both our said neighbours and allies, which although it ought
  to be conceded to us simply on account of our mutual friendship and our
  affection towards your highness and the illustrious Order of Malta, still
  we shall receive so gratefully, that if at any time we can do anything to
  please your highness, we shall be always ready to do it, with all
  attention, and most willingly.</p>

  <p>In the meantime we heartily recommend your highness and all the
  members of the illustrious Order of Malta, as well as all your affairs,
  to the Divine keeping.</p>

  <p>Most eminent Prince, our well-beloved cousin and friend.</p>

  <p>The military order over which your eminence most worthily presides,
  having always used its power to render the navigation of the sea safe and
  peaceable for Christians, we in no way doubt that our ships of war, armed
  for the same purpose, will receive from your eminence every office of
  friendship. We therefore are desirous of signifying to your eminence by
  these our letters that we have sent a squadron of our royal fleet to the
  Mediterranean sea under the command of Sir John Narbrough, knight, to
  look after the safety of navigation and commerce, and to oppose the
  enemies of public tranquillity. We therefore amicably beseech your
  eminence that if ever the above-named Admiral Narbrough, or any of our
  ships cruising under his flag, should arrive at any of your eminence's
  ports or stations, or in any place subject to the Order of Malta, that
  they may be considered and treated as friends and allies, and that they
  may be permitted to purchase with their money, and at just prices, and to
  export provisions and munitions of war, and whatever they may require,
  which, on similar occasions, we will abundantly reciprocate to your
  eminence and to your most noble Order.</p>

  <p>Although we in no way doubt of the sincere readiness of your eminence
  and of your holy Order of Malta to do everything which might be known to
  be expedient for our interests, still we could not read your eminence's
  letters under date of 24th March last, in which such readiness is fully
  set forth, without the greatest pleasure. Our affection is sharpened and
  excited by the mention of the good will of our predecessors, the Kings of
  Great Britain, evinced in every age towards your most illustrious Order,
  which, as your eminence in your said letters so honourably commemorates,
  so will we studiously endeavour to imitate, and even to surpass. From our
  admiral, Sir John Narbrough, knight, and also from other parties, we have
  heard with how much benignity your eminence lately received him, and
  caused him and the other officers of our fleet to be supplied with what
  was requisite for our ships of war, which we consider not less worthy of
  the piety and valour of your Order than of our friendship; and we on our
  part, on opportunity presenting itself, will be careful to abundantly
  reciprocate by every kind of good offices.</p>

  <p>We know not how it came to pass that our admiral in the Mediterranean
  sea, Sir John Narbrough, knight, should have given such cause of
  complaint as mentioned in your eminence's letters addressed to us under
  date of the 5th of April, as to have refused to give the usual salute to
  the city <!-- Page 444 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  something had been omitted on the part of the Maltese which he considered
  due to our dignity, and to the flag of our royal fleet. Be it, however,
  as it may, your eminence may be persuaded that it is our fixed and
  established intention to do and perform everything both ourselves and by
  our officers amply to show how much we esteem the sacred person of your
  eminence and the Order of Malta.</p>

  <p>In order, therefore, that it should already appear that we do not wish

<h3>DISEASE AMONG CATTLE.</h3>

  <p>For some years past, a great many cattle have died from a disease of
  the lungs, for which I believe no effectual antidote has been discovered.
  This fact having been mentioned to a German in London, who had formerly
  been a <i>Rossarzt</i> or veterinary surgeon in the Prussian army, he
  stated that he had known a similar disease to prevail in Germany; and
  that by administering a decoction of <i>Erica communis</i> (Common
  Heath), mixed with tar, the progress of the disease had in many instances
  been arrested.</p>

  <p>In order, therefore, that the British farmer may obtain the benefit of
  this gentleman's experience, and that he may receive all manner of
  justice, I beg leave to send you a literal copy of the recipe which he
  was kind enough to give <i>pro bono publico</i>.</p>

<p class="cenhead">"REMEDY AGAINST THE PRESENT DISEASE AMONG CATTLE.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Taken Erika communis, and boiled it into water of such quantity, that
  the water after boiling coloured like beer; generally of a pinte of water
  ¼&mdash;½ lb. Erika communis, and boiling 5 to 6 hours. After it is be
  done, filled the fluids trough a seive in ather boiler, and mixed the
  same with 1/20 part of common tear. In order to make a good composition
  from it, you must boiling the tear and the fluide to a second time of
  2&mdash;3 hour's and much storret. After then the medecin is to by
  ready.</p>

  <p>"Everry cattle sicke or well must you giving of three times to day,
  everry time one pot from the said mixture, which you have befor keapet a
  little warm but not to much heat. Keepet werry much from the fluide of
  Erika communis not mixed with tear, and give to drinke the cattle a much
  as possible. Everry cattle liked to drinke such fluide.</p>

  <p>"Becom's the tongue stick, black pumpels, or becom's the mouth and
  palatt red and sort, washe it out with a softe brush deyed in a mixture
  as follow described: One part of hony, 3 parts of vinaigre, 3 parts of
  water, and one half part of burned and grinded allumn.</p>

  <p>"Becom's the cattle in the legs, generally in the klawes, washed the
  sores with cold water, that you mixed 1 once white vitriol, and 1 once
  burned allumn of a pint of water, 3&mdash;4 times to day, and keepet the
  cattle everry time day's and night's in the open air of meadows or lots.
  Everry cattle become's in the first time that it is driven out the
  stables to the green feeding of meadow's, &amp;c. a little sickness,
  generally a little diarrhae, and this is a remedy against the disease as
  before stated.</p>

  <p>"If you continnuit with the firste remedy, you should findet that the
  cattle becom's a verry slight influence of the said disease."</p>

<h3>POPIANA.</h3>

  <p>I. In Roscoe's edition of <i>Pope</i>, vol. iv. p.&nbsp;465., is this
  epitaph:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="i1hg1">'Tis ten to one he'll ne'er come back."</p>
    </div>

  <p>This must have been running in Goldsmith's heed when he wrote:</p>

  <p>III. In "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. i., p.&nbsp;245., the following passage
  occurs:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the Imitation of the <i>Second Satire, Book I.</i> of Horace,
  <i>only to be found in modern editions</i>, there is an allusion to 'poor
  E&mdash;&mdash;s,' who suffered by 'the fatal steel' for an intrigue with
  a Royal Mistress."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Query, in <i>what</i> modern editions is this imitation found? I have
  searched most of them (including the last, and by no means the worst, by
  Mr. Robert Carruthers) in vain.</p>

  <p>IV. It has always seemed to me desirable that a perfect edition of an
  author like Pope, whose pages teem with proper names frequently repeated,
  and personal allusions, should be furnished with an Index <i>nominum
  propriorum</i>, which would enable the reader to refer in a moment to the
  exact whereabouts of the line wanted. I once took the trouble to make
  such an Index to Pope for my own use, and add one word of it as a
  specimen:</p>

  <p>Is this a hint worthy the notice of Mr. Croker, Mr. P. Cunningham, or
  Mr. John Murray, whose joint labours promise us a new edition of
  Pope?</p>

  <p>V. Roscoe and Croly give <i>four</i> poems on <i>Gulliver's
  Travels</i>. Why does Mr. Carruthers leave out the <i>third</i>? His
  edition appears to contain (besides many additions) all that all previous
  editors have admitted, with the exception of this <i>third</i> Gulliver
  poem, the sixteen additional verses to Mrs. Blount on leaving town, the
  verses to Dr. Bolton, and a fragment of eight lines (perhaps by
  Congreve); which last three are to be found in Warton's edition.</p>

<h3>HAMPSHIRE FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Churching.</i>&mdash;A woman in this village, when going to church
  for the first time after the birth of her child, keeps to the same side
  of the road, and no persuasions or threats would induce her to cross it.
  She wears also upon that occasion a pair of new boots or shoes, so that
  the mothers of large families patronise greatly the disciples of St.
  Crispin. I should much like to know if this twofold superstition is
  prevalent, and how it first originated.</p>

  <p><i>Bees.</i>&mdash;There is not one peasant I believe in this village,
  man or woman, who would sell you a swarm of bees. To be guilty of selling
  bees is a grievous omen indeed, than which nothing can be more dreadful.
  To barter bees is quite a different matter. If you want a hive, you may
  easily obtain it in lieu of a small pig, or some other equivalent. There
  may seem little difference in the eyes of enlightened persons between
  selling, and bartering, but the superstitious beekeeper sees a grand
  distinction, and it is not his fault if you don't see it too.</p>

  <p>When a hive swarms, it is customary to take the shovel from the grate,
  and the key from the door, and to produce therewith a species of music
  which is supposed to captivate and soothe the winged tribe. If the bees
  do not settle on any neighbouring tree where they may have the full
  benefit of the inharmonious music, they are generally assailed with
  stones. This is a strange sort of proceeding, but it is orthodox, and
  there is nothing the villagers despise more than modern innovations of
  whatever kind.</p>

  <p><i>Charming.</i>&mdash;As regards charming, the wife of the village
  innkeeper who preceded the present one (she now rests in the churchyard),
  used to whisper away burns. Her form of words, if she had any, is
  unknown. The mind has great influence upon the body, and the doctor knows
  it, or he would not give his nervous lady patients so many boxes of bread
  pills, and sleeping draughts in the shape of vials filled with savoury
  rum-punch. Doubtless this good woman cured her patients by acting on
  their imaginations. If the agency of imagination is an incorrect
  supposition, I see but one way of accounting for the curative powers of
  whispering, namely, by means of animal magnetism. I trust your medical
  readers do not question the curative powers of animal magnetism in
  certain cases; if they do, I would recommend them to read a work entitled
  <i>Human Magnetism, its Claim to Dispassionate Inquiry</i>, by W.
  Newnham, Esq., M.R.S.L. It is published by John Churchill, Princes
  Street, Soho.</p>

<h3>THE MOST CURIOUS BOOK IN THE WORLD.</h3>

  <p>The following account of this truly wonderful specimen of human
  patience and skill is from a rough copy that I took some years ago. I
  regret that I cannot give any reference, as I made no note of my
  authority, which has now escaped my <!-- Page 447 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page447"></a>{447}</span>recollection. But that
  is of little consequence, as the book is well known to
  bibliographists.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most singular bibliographic curiosity is that which
  belonged to the family of the Prince de Ligne, and is now in France. It
  is entitled <i>Liber Passionis Domini nostri Jesu Christi, cum
  Characteribus nulla materia compositis</i>. This book is neither written
  nor printed! The whole letters of the text are cut out of each folio upon
  the finest vellum; and being interleaved with blue paper, is read as
  easily as the best print. The labour and patience bestowed in its
  completion must have been excessive, especially when the precision and
  minuteness of the letters are considered. The general execution, in every
  respect, is indeed admirable; and the vellum is of the most delicate and
  costly kind. Rodolphus II. of Germany offered for it, in 1640, 11,000
  ducats, which was probably equal to 60,000 at this day. The most
  remarkable circumstance connected with this literary treasure is, that it
  bears the royal arms of England; but it cannot be traced to have ever
  been in this country.</p>

  <p>I now offer this notice, in the hope that the readers of "N. &amp; Q."
  may supply farther particulars; such as the time of its commencement or
  completion, and also whether it is still in France. With respect to the
  arms of England, which yet present a puzzle to all antiquaries, I beg to
  submit a conjecture. I think it was intended as a present to our Henry
  VIII., when he was in such high favour at Rome, for his <i>Defence of the
  Seven Sacraments</i>, that Leo X. conferred on him the title of "Fidei
  Defensor," and which all our sovereigns have subsequently retained. But
  when he threw off the Papal authority, declared himself supreme head of
  the Church, and proceeded to confiscate its property, the intention of
  presentation was abandoned. This is at least plausible, as I do not mean
  that it was <i>originally</i> designed for a present to "bluff Harry,"
  because it was produced before he was born. But the arms were a work for
  any time; and I think they were executed just before his rupture with the
  Pope was known. To pay him a compliment afterwards from any part of
  Catholic Europe was, of course, out of the question.</p>

<h3>ANCIENT TENURE OF LANDS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., pp. 173. 309.)</p>

  <p>The following paragraphs, containing both Notes and Queries, will
  doubtless interest your readers</p>

  <p>At the last Kent assizes held at Maidstone (March, 1854) a case was
  tried by a special jury, of whom the writer was one, before Mr. Baron
  Parke; plaintiffs, "the Earl of Romney and others," trustees under an act
  of parliament to pay the debts of the borough of Queenborough, county
  Kent; defendants, "the Inclosure Commissioners of England and Wales."
  Tradition relates that Edward III. was so pleased with his construction
  of the Castle of Queenborough, that he complimented his consort by not
  only building a town, but creating a borough<a name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, which he named after her honour.<a
  name="footnotetag5" href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> The case, in
  various shapes, has been before the law courts for some time, and was
  sent to these Kent assizes to ascertain whether Queenborough was either a
  manor or a reputed manor. In the course of the trial Baron Parke said,
  that, in despite of the statute <i>Quia Emptores</i>, he should rule that
  manors could be created when they contained the essentials.</p>

  <p>My first Query is, therefore, Have any manors been created in England
  since the passing of that statute? In my <i>History of Deptford</i> I
  have alluded to the manor of Hatcham as one of the last manors I supposed
  to have been created.</p>

  <p>The Inclosure Commissioners, as the defendants, had been prayed by the
  Leeze-holders<a name="footnotetag6" href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
  of <!-- Page 449 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page449"></a>{449}</span>Queenborough to inclose sundry lands
  called Queenborough Common; such inclosure was opposed by the trustees,
  who claimed under the act of parliament which constituted their existence
  to be in the position of the mayor<a name="footnotetag7"
  href="#footnote7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, &amp;c., and thus, if they were the
  lords of the manor, to have a veto upon the inclosure of the waste. The
  plaintiffs relied very much upon the following fact, which I here embalm
  as a <i>note</i>, and append thereon a <i>query</i>:&mdash;During the
  Mayoralty of Mr. Greet<a name="footnotetag8"
  href="#footnote8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>, a gentleman who died in 1829, a
  turbot was caught by a dredger on the Queenborough oyster-grounds: this
  unlucky fish was immediately pounced upon by the Queenborough officials,
  and seized for the mayor's behoof as his perquisite, <i>à la</i>
  sturgeon.</p>

  <p>Query, a like instance?</p>

  <p>The Jury, after two days' long sitting, decided that Queenborough was
  neither a manor nor a reputed manor.</p>

  <p>Of Mr. Greet's mayoralty many humorous tales are told: he was at times
  popular, but towards the close of his reign most decidedly the reverse.
  At his funeral the dredgers, &amp;c. threw halfpence into his grave to
  pay his passage to the lower regions. He, one day, <i>ex officio</i>,
  sentenced a pilferer to a flogging at the cart's tail, and as
  executioners did not volunteer, he took off his coat, and himself applied
  the cat to the bare back of the culprit from one end of the street to the
  other. Mr. Greet was one of the best friends Queenborough ever had. After
  his death it plunged deeply into debt, had its paraphernalia and books
  seized and sold by the sheriff, and now all its property is in the hands
  of trustees to pay its debts, whilst its poor-rates are, a witness, a
  late mayor said, nine shillings in the pound. The debt was originally
  12,700<i>l.</i>; but as no interest has been paid thereon, it is now
  17,000<i>l.</i> The trustees have received about 4,000<i>l</i>., but this
  sum has been melted in subsequent litigation; for Queenborough men are
  mightily fond of supporting the law courts.</p>

<h3>OWEN ROWE THE REGICIDE.</h3>

  <p>Mark Noble, in his <i>Lives of the Regicides</i>, says that Owen Rowe
  was descended from Sir Thomas Rowe, Lord Mayor of London in 1568. In the
  Additional Manuscripts (British Museum), 6337. p.&nbsp;52., is a coat in
  trick: Argent, on a chevron azure, three bezants between three trefoils
  per pale gules and vert, a martlet sable for difference; crest, a roe's
  head couped gules, attired or, rising from a wreath; and beneath is
  written, "Coll. Row, Coll. of hors and futt." These arms I imagine to
  have been the regicide's. If so, he was a fourth son. Query, whose? The
  Hackney Parish Register records, that on Nov. 6, 1655, Captain Henry Rowe
  was buried from Mr. Simon Corbet's, of Mare Street, Hackney. How was he
  related to Colonel Owen Rowe? I should feel particularly obliged to any
  correspondent who could furnish me with his descent from Sir Thos.
  Rowe.</p>

  <p>According to Mr. Lysons (<i>Environs of London</i>, vol. iv. p.&nbsp;540.),
  the daughter of Mr. Rowland Wilson, and widow of Dr. Crisp, married
  Colonel Rowe; adding in a note, that he <i>supposes</i> this Colonel Rowe
  to have been Colonel Owen Rowe, the regicide. The same statement is found
  in Hasted's <i>History of Kent</i> (edit. 1778), vol. i. p.&nbsp;181. I should
  be glad of some more certain information on this point; also, what issue
  Owen Rowe left, if any, besides two daughters, whose marriages are
  recorded in the Hackney Register.</p>

  <p>I am likewise anxious to learn whether there exist any lineal
  descendants of this family of Rowe, which had its origin in Kent; and
  thence branching off in the sixteenth century, settled and obtained large
  possessions in Shacklewell, Walthamstow, Low Layton, Higham Hill, and
  Muswell Hill. Through females, several of our nobility are descended from
  them.</p>

<h3>WRITINGS OF THE MARTYR BRADFORD.</h3>

  <p>The second and concluding volume of Bradford's writings, which I am
  editing for the Parker Society, is about to be concluded.</p>

  <p>Bradford's <i>Treatise against the Fear of Death, with Sweet
  Meditations on the Felicity of the Life to Come and the Kingdom of
  Christ</i>, was printed by Powell without a date, by Singleton without a
  date, and by Wolf 1583,&mdash;the last two editions being mentioned by
  Herbert, the first of Powell by Dibdin from Herbert's MS. additions. If
  any of your readers could inform me where a copy of any one of these
  editions is to be found, it would greatly oblige.</p>

  <p>I have also never met, after some years' inquiry, with the edition of
  Bradford's <i>Letter on the Mass</i>, printed by Waldegrave,
  Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>Some of the early editions of Bradford's writings are very rare. I
  possess his <i>Examinations</i>, Griffith, 1561; and <i>Meditations</i>,
  Hall, 1562; both of which are scarce: as also the only copy I have ever
  seen (though imperfect) of the first edition of his <i>Sermon on
  Repentance</i>, evidently printed in 1553.</p>

  <p>His <i>Complaint of Verity</i> is of extraordinary rarity. The only
  copy I am aware of is possessed <!-- Page 450 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page450"></a>{450}</span>by the Rev. T. Corser, of Stand,
  Manchester; and was purchased (I believe) at Mr. Bright's sale for
  17<i>l.</i></p>

  <p>I should be obliged to any one who would supply me with any
  information about early editions of Bradford's writings.</p>

  <p>Every one is familiar with the story that Bradford, on seeing a
  criminal pass to execution, said, "There goes John Bradford but for the
  grace of God." Can any one inform me of any early printed authority for
  that story?</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Courtney Family.</i>&mdash;I throw an apple of discord to your
  heraldic, genealogical, and antiquarian, readers. Was there originally
  more than one family of Courtnay, Courtney, Courtenay, Courteney,
  Courtnaye, Courtenaye, &amp;c. Which is right, and when did the family

  <p>"<i>The Shipwrecked Lovers.</i>"&mdash;Can you give me any account of
  the following tragedy, where the scene of it is laid, &amp;c.? It is
  printed along with some poems, and appears never to have been acted. The
  name of the piece is <i>The Shipwrecked Lovers</i>, a tragedy in five
  acts, by James Templeton, Dublin, 12mo., 1801. I regret that I am unable
  to give any account of the author, but perhaps some of your Irish readers
  may be able to do this.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Sigma.</span></p>

  <p><i>Sir John Bingham.</i>&mdash;In Burke's <i>Peerage and
  Baronetage</i>, article "Lucan," it is stated that this gentlemen was
  high in rank in King James's army at the battle of Aughrim, and turned
  the fortune of the day in favour of William by deserting, with his whole
  command, at the crisis of the battle. A late number of the <i>Dublin
  University Magazine</i> repeats this story on the authority of Mr. Burke,
  and it would therefore be satisfactory to know where the latter found a
  statement affecting so much the honour of the family in question, one of
  the first in my native county. The dates of Sir John's birth and marriage
  are not given, but the ages of several of his children are known, and
  from them it follows that, supposing the father of the first Lord Lucan
  not to have married till the mature age of fifty-five or sixty, he was
  barely of age at the time of the battle, therefore not likely to have
  been high in command. My countrymen are too much inclined, like the
  French, to attribute their disasters to treachery, or to any cause but
  the equal numbers and courage, and superior discipline, of their
  adversaries: but they have never done so to less purpose than when they
  ascribe the loss of that battle to a man who was in all probability not
  born in 1691, and must in any case have been a mere boy at the time. No
  peerage that I have met with gives the date of his birth, which would at
  once settle the question. It seems most unlikely, if such were actually
  the case, that the family, on attaining the peerage, should have revived
  the title of the gallant Sarsfield (whose representatives they were), and
  thus challenged public attention, always on the alert on such points in
  Ireland, to their alleged dishonour and betrayal of the cause for which
  he fought and fell.</p>

  <p><i>Judges practicing at the Bar.</i>&mdash;A curious disquisition has
  run through "N. &amp; Q." on the relinquishment of their sees by bishops,
  but I do not see that any of them are shown to have officiated as parish
  priests after quitting the episcopate.</p>

  <p>Not that this is the point I wish now to put before you and your
  readers, but I want information on a somewhat kindred subject.</p>

  <p>In Craik's <i>Romance of the Peerage</i> there occurs:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Percy's leading counsel upon this occasion was Mr. Sergeant (<span
  class="correction" title="Original reads `aftewards' - reference checked."
  >afterwards</span> Sir Francis) Pemberton, who subsequently rose to be
  first a puisne judge, and then Chief Justice of the King's Bench, was
  thence transferred to the Chief Justiceship of the Common Pleas, and
  after all ended his days a practitioner at the bar."&mdash;Vol. iv.
  p.&nbsp;<span class="correction" title="Original reads `29' - reference checked."
  >291</span>. note.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Pemberton, it appears, was dismissed from the Common Pleas in 1683; he
  was counsel for the seven bishops in 1688, as was also another displaced
  judge, Sir Creswell Leving, or Levinge, who was superseded in 1686.</p>

  <p>Are these the only two instances of judges, <i>qui olim fuere</i>,
  practising at the bar? If not, are they the latest? And farther, if not
  the latest, does not etiquette forbid such practice now?</p>

  admitted to the honour of a degree of Doctors of Physic, in the
  university of this place, after having undergone the usual examinations,
  both private and public. The former of whom was also presented some time
  before with the freedom of this city."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Benjamin Rush here referred to subsequently became quite eminent
  as a physician. He took an active part in the struggle between the
  American colonies and the mother country, and was one of the signers of
  the Declaration of Independence. One of his sons was the American
  minister to London a few years since.</p>

  <p><i>Burial Service Tradition.</i>&mdash;About forty years ago, a young
  man hung himself. When his body was taken to the church for interment,
  the clergymen refused reading the burial service over him; his friends
  took him to another parish, and the clergyman of that place refused also;
  they then removed him to an adjoining one, and the clergyman received him
  and buried him. The last clergyman said, if any friend of the deceased
  had cut off his right hand, and laid it outside the coffin, no clergyman
  then could refuse legally receiving and burying the corpse. Query, is
  this true?</p>

  <p>May I ask your readers for an answer, as it will oblige many friends.

  which contained the remains of this lady and her family was accidentally
  broken into, and that the bodies of herself, her husband, and some
  children, were found decapitated, with their heads under their arms;
  moreover, that in all the coffins there were dice. My informant had read
  an authenticated account of this curious circumstance, which was drawn up
  at the time of the discovery, but he could not refer me to it, and it is

  <p>"Feb. 8. Died at her house in Chapel Street, near Ratcliff Highway,
  aged 95, Margaret M&lsquo;Kennow, who kept a lodging-house in that

<div class="note">
  <p>[The system of paying seamen with tickets instead of cash caused great
  discontent during the reign of Charles II., and, from the frequent
  notices respecting it in Pepys's <i>Diary</i>, seems to have given our
  Diarist great trouble. On November 30, 1660, he says: "Sir G. Carteret
  did give us an account how Mr. Holland do intend to prevail with the
  parliament to try his project of discharging the seamen all at present by
  ticket, and so promise interest to all men that will lend money upon them
  at eight per cent. for so long as they are unpaid, whereby he do think to
  take away the growing debt which do now lie upon the kingdom for lack of
  present money to discharge the seamen." These tickets the poor fellows
  sold at half price to usurers, mostly Jews; and to so great an extent was
  the system carried, that in the year 1710 there was a floating debt due
  to these usurers of ten millions paid by Harley from a fictitious fund
  formed by the government.]</p>

  <p>[This work is by John Barbour (sometimes written Barber, Barbere, and

  he received his education at the Abbey of Aberbrothock, where he took
  orders, and obtained a living near Aberdeen. Dr. Henry supposes Barbour
  to have become Archdeacon of Aberdeen in 1356. It is probable he died
  towards the close of 1395. His poem has passed through several editions,
  and is considered of high historical value. The earlier editions are
  those of Edinburgh, 1616, 1670, 12mo. In 1790, Pinkerton published "the

  <p><i>Coronation Custom.</i>&mdash;At the coronations of Henry IV. and
  Richard III. a ceremony was performed which seems to indicate some idea
  of the elective sovereignty in England. The archbishop stood at each of
  the four corners of the dais in succession, and asked from thence the
  consent of the assembled Commons (Heylin, <i>Reform.</i>, 1st edit.,
  p.&nbsp;32.). Did this ever take place at the coronation of English monarchs
  whose succession was not disputed?</p>

  <p class="author">J. H. B.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[In after times this ceremony seems to be that called "The
  Recognition." Sandford, speaking of the coronation of James II., says,
  "The Archbishop of Canterbury standing near the king, on the east side of
  the theatre, his majesty, attended as before, rose out of his chair, and
  stood before it, whilst the archbishop, having his face to the east, said
  as follows: 'Sirs. I here present unto you King James, the rightful
  inheritor of the crown of this realm; wherefore all ye that are come this
  day to do your homage, service, and bounden duty, are ye willing to do
  the same?' From thence the said archbishop, accompanied with the lord
  keeper, the lord great chamberlain, the lord high constable, and the earl
  marshal (garter king of arms going before them), proceeded to the south
  side of the theatre, and repeated the same words; and from thence to the
  west, and lastly to the north side of the theatre, in like manner: the
  king standing all this while by his chair of state, toward the east side
  of the theatre, and turning his face to the several sides of the theatre,
  at such time as the archbishop at every of them spake to the people. At
  every of which the people signified their willingness and joy by loud
  acclamations."]</p>

  left the opportunity for a few stray gleanings in the field of their

  were condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered; and hanged they were

  delivered it at the place of execution, and so their lives were
  saved."&mdash;P. 77.</p>

  <p>The following document from the Patent Rolls of the forty-eighth year
  of the reign of King Henry III. (skin 5.) affords conclusive evidence of
  the affirmative:</p>

  <p>"She could not be hanged, upon account that the larynx, or upper part
  of her windpipe, was turned to bone, as Fallopius (<i>Oper.</i>, tom. i.,
  <i>Obs. Anat.</i>, tract. 6.) tells us he has sometimes found it, which
  possibly might be so strong, that the weight of her body could not
  compress it, as it happened in the case of a Swiss, who, as I am told by
  the Rev. Mr. Obadiah Walker, Master of University College, was attempted
  to be hanged no less than thirteen times, yet lived notwithstanding, by
  the benefit of his windpipe, that after his death was found to have
  turned into a bone; which yet is still wonderful, since the circulation
  of the blood must be stopt, however, unless his veins and arteries were
  likewise turned to bone, or the rope not slipt close."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Besides the account of Anne Green, Denham, in the 4th book of his
  <i>Physico-Theology</i>, quotes the following instance from Rechelin
  (<i>De Aere et Alim. defect.</i>, cap. vii.),&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Of a certain woman hang'd, and in all appearance dead, who was
  nevertheless restored to life by a physician accidentally coming in, and

  <p>(See also <i>The Uncertainty of the Signs of Death, and the Danger of
  precipitate Interments and Dissections demonstrated</i>, 12mo., London,
  1751.)</p>

  <p>A paragraph, stating that Fauntleroy, the notorious forger, had
  survived his execution, and was living abroad, has more than once gone
  the round of the newspapers. It is sometimes added that his evidence was
  required in a Chancery suit,&mdash;absurdly enough, as, if not
  <i>actually</i>, he was at least <i>legally</i> dead.</p>

  <p>The story of Brodie, executed October, 1788, for an excise robbery at
  Edinburgh, is probably familiar to most. The self-possession and firmness
  with which he met his fate was the result of a belief in the possibility
  of his resuscitation:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is a curious fact, that an attempt was made to resuscitate Brodie
  immediately after the execution. The operator was Degravers, whom Brodie
  himself had employed. His efforts, however, were utterly abortive. A
  person who witnessed the scene, accounted for the failure by saying that
  the hangman, having been bargained with for a short fall, his excess of
  caution made him shorten the rope too much at first, and when he
  afterwards lengthened it, he made it too long, which consequently proved
  fatal to the experiment."&mdash;<i>Curiosities of Biography</i>, 8vo.,
  Glasgow, 1845.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is a powerfully-written story in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>,
  April, 1827, entitled "Le Revenant," in which a resuscitated felon is
  supposed to describe his feelings and experience. The author, in his
  motto, makes a sweeping division of mankind:&mdash;"There are but two
  classes in the world&mdash;those who are <i>hanged</i>, and those who are
  <i>not hanged</i>; and it has been my lot to belong to the former." Many
  well-authenticated cases might still be adduced; but enough at least has
  now probably been said upon the subject, to show the possibility of
  surviving the tender mercies of Professor Calcraft and his
  fraternity.</p>

  not wishing to be disappointed of the dissection, seized a wooden mall,
  with which he deprived him of life. It was farther reported, as the just
  vengeance of God, that this young man was soon after killed in the stable
  by his own horse. They used to show a mall at the surgeons' hall, as the

<h3>COLERIDGE'S CHRISTABEL.</h3>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. J. S. Warden</span> might well express
  astonishment at the rash and groundless statement in "Blackwood" (Dec.
  1839), that the third part of Christabel which Dr. Maginn sent to that
  magazine in 1820 "perplexed the public, <i>and pleased even
  Coleridge</i>." How far the "discerning public" were imposed upon I know
  not; the following extract will show how far the poet-philosopher was
  "pleased" with the parody.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If I should finish 'Christabel,' I shall certainly extend it, and
  give new characters, and a greater number of incidents. This the 'reading
  public' require, and this is the reason that Sir Walter Scott's poems,
  though so loosely written, are pleasing, and interest us by their
  picturesqueness. If a genial recurrence of the ray divine should occur
  for a few weeks, I shall certainly attempt it. I had the whole of the two
  cantos in my mind before I began it; certainly the first canto is more
  perfect, has more of the true wild weird spirit than the last. I laughed
  heartily at the continuation in 'Blackwood,' which I have been told is by
  Maginn. It is in appearance, and in appearance <i>only</i>, a good
  imitation. I do not doubt but that it gave more pleasure, and to a
  greater number, than a continuation by myself in the spirit of the two
  first (<i>sic</i>) cantos (<i>qu.</i> would give)."&mdash;<i>Letters,

<h3>GENERAL WHITELOCKE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 201.)</p>

  <p>General Whitelocke being on a visit to Aboyne Castle, in this county,
  the seat of the late Marquis of Huntley, then Earl of Aboyne, and a
  public market being held in the neighbourhood, the Earl, the General, and
  some other visitors, were seen sauntering amongst the cattle and the
  tents of the fair. Amongst the attenders of the country markets at that
  period was a woman of the name of Tibby Masson, well known in this city
  for her masculine character and deeds of fearlessness. Tibby had
  accompanied her husband, who was a soldier, to South America; and, along
  with him, had been present at the unfortunate siege of Buenos Ayres; and,
  as a trophy of her valour, she brought with her an enormous-sized silver
  watch, which she declared she had taken from the person of a Spanish
  officer who lay wounded in the neighbourhood of the city after the
  engagement. Tibby was standing by her "sweetie" (confectionary) stall in
  the Aboyne Market when the Earl and Whitelocke, and the other gentlemen,
  were passing, and she at once recognised her old commander. They stopped,
  and the General tasted some of her "sweeties," and saucily declared that
  they were abominably bad. Upon which Tibby immediately retorted: "They
  are a great deal better than the timmer (wooden) flints that you gave our
  soldiers at Bonny's Airs." On hearing this, the consternation of
  Whitelocke and his friends can more easily be imagined than described.
  They all fled from the field with the utmost rapidity, leaving Tibby
  completely victorious; and the General, so far as is known, never again
  visited Aberdeenshire.</p>

  <p>I have not access to a file of newspapers, but have been frequently

  ere a flint in our muskets."</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Gravelly Wax Negatives.</i>&mdash;The only remedy I am acquainted
  with is to use the paper within twenty-four hours after excitement. I
  have tried the methods of Messrs. Crookes, Fenton, and How; in every case
  I was equally annoyed with gravel, if excited beyond that time; in fact,
  I believe all the good wax negatives have been taken within twelve hours.
  The Rev. Wm. Collings, who has produced such excellent wax negatives, 24
  in. × 18 (several were sent to the late Exhibition of the Photographic
  Society), informs me the above is quite his experience, and that he
  excites his papers for the day early in the morning. The cause lies, I
  believe, in the fault of homogeneity of the waxed paper, arising from
  unevenness in the structure of the paper exaggerated by the transparency
  of the wax, partly, perhaps, from a semi-crystallizing of the wax in
  cooling, and also from its being adulterated with tallow, resin, &amp;c.
  As a consequence of this, the paper is filled with innumerable hard
  points; the iodizing and exciting solutions are unequally absorbed, and
  the actinic influence acting more on the weak points, produces under
  gallic acid a speckled appearance, if decomposition has gone to any
  length in the exciting nitrate by keeping. The céroléine process, by its
  power of penetrating, will, I hope, produce an homogeneous paper, and go
  far to remove this annoyance.</p>

  <p>In answer to a former Query by <span class="sc">Mr. Hele</span>,
  Whatman's paper of 1849 is lightly sized, and not hard rolled, so that
  twenty minutes' washing in repeated water sufficed to remove the iodide
  of potassium, and if long soaked the paper became porous, often letting
  the gallic acid through in the development. I have lately been trying
  Turner's and Sandford's papers; they require three or four hours'
  repeated washing to get rid of the salts, being very hard rolled. Many
  negatives on Turner's paper, especially if weak, exhibit a structural
  appearance like linen, the unequal density gives almost exactly the same
  gravelly character as wax, as the positive I inclose, taken from such a
  negative, shows. Not only ought collodion to be "structureless," as <span
  class="sc">Mr. Shadbolt</span> well expresses it, but likewise all the
  other substrata of iodide of silver.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">T. L. Mansell.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Guernsey.</p>

  <p><i>Photographic Experience.</i>&mdash;The plan proposed by <span
  class="sc">Dr. Mansell</span>, in the last Number of "N. &amp; Q.," for
  comparison of photographic experiences, will, I am sure, prove of much
  practical advantage and I therefore lose no time in filling up the table
  published in your paper:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. Eight minutes' exposure.</p>
      <p>2. South Wales.</p>
      <p>3. Mr. Talbot's original receipt.</p>
      <p>4. Turner.</p>
      <p>5. &#x215C; inch.</p>
      <p>6. 2 inches.</p>
      <p>7. 3 inches. Focal length, 17 inches. Maker, Ross.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I would also suggest that the character of the object copied should be
  included in the above table. My answer supposes a light-coloured
  building, of an ordinary sandstone colour. A view comprising foliage
  would require a much longer time for its full development. In working on
  the sea-coast, I find that the dark slate rocks of north Cornwall require
  an exposure in the camera half as long again as the blue mountain
  limestone cliffs of South Wales, which abound in actinic power.</p>

  <p><i>Christ's or Cris Cross Row</i> (Vol. viii., p. 18.).&mdash;The
  Alphabet. See <i>The Romish Beehive</i>, 319.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In Bacon's <i>Reliques of Rome</i>, p. 257., describing the hallowing
  of churches, among other ceremonies is the following: 'There must be made
  in the pavement of the church a crosse of ashes and sand wherein the
  whole Alphabet, or Christ's Crosse, shall be written in Greek and Latin
  letters.'</p>

  <p>"Sir Thos. More, in his Works, p. 606. <span class="scac">H</span>,
  says, 'Crosse Rowe was printed on cards for learners.' I first went to
  school at a dame's, and had a Horn-Book (as it was called), in which was
  the Alphabet in a form something like that here given, and the dame
  called me and other beginners to learn our 'Cris Cross Row;' at that time
  the term was used, that is, about seventy years since."</p>

  <p><i>Titles to the Psalms in the Syriac Version.</i>&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Mr. T.&nbsp;J. Buckton</span> (Vol. ix., p. 242.) observes, in
  reference to the superscription <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="LMNTSCH BNGYNT" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DC;&#x5DE;&#x5E0;&#x5E6;&#x5D7;
  &#x5D1;&#x5E0;&#x5D2;&#x5D9;&#x5E0;&#x5EA;</bdo></span>&#x200E;, "For the
  chief performer on the neginoth," that "the Syriac and Arabic versions
  omit this superscription altogether, from <i>ignorance</i> of the musical
  sense of the words." And lower down he speaks as if <span lang="he"
  class="heb" title="NCHYLWT" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E0;&#x5D7;&#x5D9;&#x5DC;&#x5D5;&#x5EA;</bdo></span>&#x200E;
  were expressed in the Syriac by the word "church." I do not question the
  accuracy of <span class="sc">Mr. B.</span>'s renderings of the Hebrew
  words, for they have been admitted for centuries; but I wish to observe
  that the translator of the Syriac should not be lightly charged with
  ignorance of Hebrew, as I can testify from an extensive acquaintance with
  that venerable version. I therefore cannot allow that the words were
  omitted by the translator for that reason. Besides, whenever he found a
  word untranslateable, he transferred it as it was. Nor do I admit that
  <i>nehiloth</i>, in Psalm v., is translated by the term "church." And
  this leads me to remark, what seems to have been overlooked by most
  writers, viz. that the Syriac version <i>omits</i> uniformly the titles
  of the Psalms as they are found in Hebrew<a name="footnotetag9"
  href="#footnote9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>. The inscriptions contained in the
  common editions of these Psalms form no part of the translation. One of
  them refers to the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus! They are not always
  the same. I am acquainted with at least <i>three different sets</i> of
  these headings contained in the Syriac MSS. in the British Museum.
  Erpenius omitted them altogether in his edition of the Psalter, and
  Dathe's follows his; for which very substantial reasons are given by him
  in the "Præf. ad Lect." of his <i>Psalterium Syriacum</i>, pp. 36, 37.,
  Halæ, 1768.</p>

  <p>"<i>Old Rowley</i>" (Vol. ix., p. 235.).&mdash;The nickname of "Old
  Rowley," as applied to Charles II., seems to be derived from Roland, and
  has reference to the proverbial saying, "A Roland for an Oliver;" the
  former name being given to Charles, in contradistinction to the
  Protector's name of Oliver. Roland and Oliver were two celebrated horses,
  or, as some say, two pages of Charlemagne possessing equal qualities and
  hence, "I'll give you a Roland for your Oliver" was tantamount to "I'll
  give you as good as you send."<a name="footnotetag10"

  <p><i>Wooden Effigies</i> (Vol.ix., p. 17.).&mdash;I beg to refer your
  readers to two figures which are in excellent preservation, and I am not
  aware that they have ever obtained public notice. In the church at
  Boxted, near Sudbury, Suffolk, which is the burial-place of the ancient
  family of Poley of Boxted Hall, are, with several other interesting
  monuments, the effigies of William Poley and Alice Shaa, his wife.</p>

  <p>He is in armour, with a beard, and the lady in the dress of her day,
  with a long pendant from her girdle, having suspended a small thick book
  and the arms of Poley impaling Shaa on the cover. At her feet a greyhound
  to fill up the space, in consequence of the lady being short, and their
  heads on the same line. There is an inscription in relief on the cushion
  on which the lady rests her head, which states that he died 17th
  December, 1587, and the lady March 7, <!-- Page 458 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page458"></a>{458}</span>1579. The figures rest
  on a tomb of masonry, and fill the recess of a window, with iron railing
  to protect them. Their are painted black, so that the nature of the wood
  is not apparent.</p>

  <p>Alice Shaa was the only daughter and heiress of her father, and the
  eldest son of this William and Alice was Sir John Poley, Knt. (See
  Morant's <i>Essex</i>, vol. i. pp. 151. 217. &amp;c.)</p>

  <p><i>Abbott Families</i> (Vol. ix., pp. 105. &amp;c.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Mr. Adams</span> having very satisfactorily afforded the
  required information concerning Samuel Abbott, I shall still feel very
  greatly obliged if any other gentleman can throw any light upon the
  Archbishop's descendants, especially Sir Maurice's sons and their issue.
  I have in my possession an old will of an ancestress, sealed with the
  crest of Bartholomew Barnes, of London, merchant, whose daughter was
  second wife and mother to Sir Maurice's children, viz., Bartholomew,
  George, Edward, and Maurice. Did any of them leave a son called James,
  born about 1690 or 1700?</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Every reader of the <i>Archæologia</i> knows so well the great value
  of the papers contained in it (too few in number) by the Rev. John Webb,
  that he will be sure that any work edited by that gentleman will be
  edited with diligence, intelligence, and learning. Such is the <i>Roll of
  the Household Expenses of Richard de Swinfield, Bishop of Hereford,
  during part of the Years 1289 and 1290</i>, which he has just edited for
  the Camden Society, in a manner every way worthy of his reputation, which
  is that of one of the best antiquaries of the day. The present volume
  contains only the Roll, its endorsement, and an appendix of contemporary
  and explanatory documents, the whole being richly annotated by the
  editor. Another volume will contain his introduction, glossary, &amp;c.
  On its completion we shall again call attention to a work which is so
  creditable both to Mr. Webb and to the Camden Society.</p>

  <p>The third volume of the cheap and handsome library edition of <i>The
  Works of Oliver Goldsmith</i>, edited by Peter Cunningham, F.S.A., which
  forms a portion of <i>Murray's British Classics</i>, contains I. <i>The
  Bee</i>; II. <i>Essays</i>; III. <i>Unacknowledged Essays</i>; and IV.
  <i>His Prefaces, Introductions, &amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>Our photographic friends will be glad to hear that a new edition of
  Professor Hunt's <i>Manual of Photography</i> has just been issued, in
  which the author, besides including all the most recent improvements, the
  process of photographic etching, &amp;c., has taken the opportunity of
  making such alterations in the arrangements of the several divisions of
  the subject, as have enabled him to place the various phenomena in a
  clearer view.</p>

  <p>While on the subject of scientific publications, we notice the very
  able volume just issued by Professor Beale, <i>The Microscope, and its
  Application to Clinical Medicine</i>. Though addressed more particularly
  to medical practitioners, it contains so much valuable instruction with
  respect to the management of the microscope generally, as to render it a
  valuable guide to all who are engaged in microscopic investigations.</p>

  <p>Dr. Latham will lecture on Thursday next at the Beaumont Institution,
  Mile End Road, <i>On the various Families of Mankind in the Russian and
  Turkish Empires</i>. The Lecture is for the benefit of the Colet Schools
  of the very poor district of St. Thomas, Stepney.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>The Statistical
  Companion for 1854</i>, by T.&nbsp;C. Banfield, Esq., is a most valuable
  compendium of a mass of statistical evidence gathered from Parliamentary
  Blue Books, and other authentic sources, thus supplying in one small
  volume the results of many very large ones.&mdash;<i>Addison's Works, by
  Bishop Hurd</i>. Vol. III. of this cheap and neatly-printed edition
  (which forms a part of Bohn's Series of <i>British Classics</i>) contains
  Addison's Papers from <i>The Spectator</i>.&mdash;<i>Lives of the Queens
  of England</i>, by Agnes Strickland, Vol. V., contains the Biographies of
  Anne of Denmark, Henrietta Maria, and Catherine of
  Braganza.&mdash;<i>Poetical Works of John Dryden</i>, edited by Robert
  Bell, Vol. III. This is the concluding volume of Dryden in Mr. Bell's
  <i>Annotated Edition of the English Poets</i>.&mdash;<i>Cyclopædia
  Bibliographica</i>, Part XX. The first division of this most useful
  library companion is fast drawing to a close, the present Part extending
  from Vance (William Ford) to Wilcocks (Thomas).&mdash;<i>The
  Retrospective Review</i>, No. VII., contains some amusing articles on
  Ancient Paris, Davies the Epigrammatist, the Turks in the Seventeenth
  Century, Astrology, &amp;c.</p>
